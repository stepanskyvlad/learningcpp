// 2. Add a Trust account class to the Account hierarchy
//     A Trust account has a name, a balance, and an interest rate
//     The Trust account deposit works just like a savings account deposit.
//     However, any deposits of $5000.00 or more will receive a $50.00 bonus deposited to the account.
    
//     The Trust account withdrawal should only allow 3 withdrawals per year and each of these must be less than 20% of the account balance.
//     You don't have to keep track of calendar time for this application, just make sure the 4th withdrawal fails :)
